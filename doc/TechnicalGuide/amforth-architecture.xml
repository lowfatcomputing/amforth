			<para> amforth is a 16 bit Forth implementing the indirect threading
				model. The flash memory contains the whole dictionary. A few EEPROM
				cells are used to hold initial values and the dictionary pointers.
				The RAM contains buffers, variables and the stacks.</para>
			<para> The compiler is a classic compiler without any optimization
				support.</para>
			<para> amforth uses all of the CPU registers to hold vital data: The
				data stack pointer, the instruction pointer, the user pointer, and
				the Top-Of-Stack cell. The hardware stack is used as the return
				stack. Some registers are used for temporary data in primitives.

			<para>
				The Forth VM has a few registers that need to be mapped to the
				microcontroller registers. The mapping has been extended over time
				and may cover all available registers. The actual coverage depends
				on the amount of additional packages. The default settings are shown
				in the table <xref linkend="register_mappings"/>.

			<para> In addition the register pair R0:R1 is used internally e.g. to
				hold the the result of multiply operations. The register pair R2:R3
				is used as the zero value in many words. These registers must never
				be changed.</para>
			<para> The registers from R10 to R13 are currently unused, but may be
				used for the VM extended registers X and Y sometimes. The
				registers R14 to R21 are used as temporary registers and can be used
				freely within one module as temp0 to temp7.</para>
			<para>
				The forth core uses the
				<code>T</code> Flag in the machine status register SREG for signalling 
				an interrupt. Any other code must not change that bit.

				<sect3 id="II_EXECUTE">
					<title>EXECUTE</title>
					<para> This operation reads the cell the IP currently points to and
						uses the value read as the destination of a branch. This EXECUTE
						is not the forth word EXECUTE. The forth EXECUTE sets the IP from
						the data stack TOS element.</para>
				</sect3>
				<sect3 id="II_NEXT">
					<title>NEXT</title>
					<para> The NEXT routine is the core of the inner interpreter. It
						consists of 4 steps which are executed for every forth word.
					</para>
					<para>
						The first step in NEXT is to check whether an interrupt needs to
						be handled. It is done by looking at the
						<command>T</command>
						flag in the machine status register. If it is set, the code jumps
						to the interrupt handling part. If the flag is cleared the
						following normal NEXT routine runs.
					</para>
					<para> The next step is to read the cell the IP points to and
						stores this value in the W register. For a COLON word W contains
						the address of the code field.</para>
					<para> The 3rd step is to increase the IP register by 1.</para>
					<para> The 4th step is to read the content of the cell the W
						register points to. The value is stored in the scratch pad
						register X. The data in X is the address of the machine code to be
						executed in the last step.</para>
					<para> This last step finally jumps to the machine code pointed to
						by the X scratch pad register.</para>
				</sect3>
				<sect3 id="II_DOCOLON">
					<title>DO COLON</title>
					<para> DO COLON (aka NEST) first pushes the IP (which points to the
						next word to be executed when the current word is done) to the
						return stack. It then increments W by one flash cell, so that it
						points to the body of the (colon) word, and sets IP to point to
						that value. Then it continues with NEXT, which begins executing
						the words in the body of the (parent) colon word.</para>
				</sect3>
				<sect3 id="II_EXIT">
					<title>EXIT</title>
					<para>
						The code for EXIT (aka UNNEST) is the forth word
						<command>EXIT</command>
						in the dictionary. It reads the IP from the return stack and jumps
						to NEXT. The return stack pointer is incremented by 2 (1 flash
						cell).

				<sect3 id="II_DODOES">
					<title>DO_DOES</title>
					<para>
						This code is the runtime part of the forth word
						<command>DOES></command>
						. It pushes the current address of the MCU IP register onto the
						returnstack and jumps to DO_DOES. DO_DOES gets that address back,
						saves the current IP and sets the forth IP to the address it got
						from the stack. Finally it continues with NEXT.

			<sect2 id="INTERPRETER">
			    <title>Interpreter</title>
			    <para>
			      The interpreter is a line based command interpreter. It based upon <command>REFILL</command> 
			      to acquire the next line of characters, located at a position <command>SOURCE</command> points to.
			      While processing the line, the pointer <code>>IN</code> is adjusted accordingly. Both
			      words <command>REFILL</command> and <command>SOURCE</command> are USER based deferred words which
			      allows to use any input source on a thread specific level. The interpreter itself
			      does not use any static buffers or variables (>IN is a USER variable as well).
			    </para>
			    <para>
			      A given string is handled by <command>INTERPRET</command> which splits it 
			      into whitespace delimited words. Every word is processed using a list of 
			      recognizers. Processing ends either when the string end is reached or an exception occurs.
			    </para>
			    <sect3 id="SOURCE">
			      <title>SOURCE and REFILL</title>
			      <para>
			        <command>SOURCE</command> provides an addr/len string pair that does not change
			        during processing. The task of REFILL is to fill the string buffer, SOURCE will
			        point to when finished.
			      </para>
			     <para>
			      There is one default input source: The terminal input buffer. This buffer gets filled with REFILL-TIB
			      that reads from the serial input buffers (KEY). SOURCE points to the Terminal Input Buffer itself.
			      Another input source are plain strings, used by EVALUATE.
			     </para>
			    </sect3>
			    <sect3 id="RECOGNIZER">
			      <title>Recognizer</title>
			      <para>
			        A recognizer gets the word address (API is not yet finalized) of the current word.
			        If the word can be processed, the recognizer is responsible to do so. A word from
			        the dictionary has to be either executed or compiled, a number as well. A recognizer
			        must not change the word buffer content. Finally the recognizer returns a flag to
			        the interpreter which signals success or not. This flag is consumed, any other stack
			        change is kept.
			      </para>
			      <para>
			        Three recognizers are defined: Dictionary lookup <command>rec-find</command>, 
			        integer number conversion <command>rec-intnum</command> and a not-found dummy
			        <command>rec-notfound</command>. The first two take care of the interpreter state and either
			        leave more than the flag (e.g. the number entered) or compile the information
			        to the dictionary.
			      </para>
			      <para>
			        The not-found recognizer prints the word and throws an exception -13 which can be catched.
			      </para>
			      <para>
			        The list of the recognizers is kept in the EEPROM, the maximum size of the
			        entries is a compile time setting (currently 6 slot are available).
			      </para>
			      <sect4><title>Example Recognizer</title>
			      <para>
			      A recognizer gets the address of a counted word in memory and leaves at least the flag
			      for the interpreter. If any data is to be left on the stack (e.g. numeric values) it
			      has to be beneath the flag.
			      </para>
			      <para>The small example illustrates the integration of the floating point library for amforth. 
			      It is based upon a conversion word >float which takes a string and tries to convert it into a 
			      float. The word fliteral compiles a floating point number into the dictionary.
			      <screen language="forth">
: rec-float  \ addr -- (f|) -1 | 0 
  count >float
  if state @ if postpone fliteral then -1 else 0 
  then ;
                  </screen>
                  The recognizer first tries to convert the string to a number. If that fails, the flag
                  from the >float is essentially duplicated and the recognizer is left. If the conversion
                  succeeded, the floating point number is on the data stack. The recognizer now checks
                  whether the number needs to be compiled or not. In any case the success flag is
                  returned.
                  </para>
                  
                  <para>
                    Future versions may change the API from counted strings at addr to addr/len information.

				<sect3 id="DATASTACK">
					<title>Data Stack</title>
					<para> The data stack uses the CPU register pair YH:YL as its data
						pointer. The Top-Of-Stack element (TOS) is in a register pair.
						Compared to a straight forward implementation this approach saves
						code space and gives higher execution speed (approx 10-20%). Saving even more stack
                        elements does not really provide a greater
                        benefit (much more code and only little speed
                        enhancements).

                    <para>
                        The data stack starts at a configurable distance
                        below the return stack (RAMEND) and grows
                        downward.

                        The Return Stack is the hardware stack of the
                        controller. It is managed with push/pop
                        assembler instructions. The default return stack
                        starts at RAMEND and grows downward.

                    Amforth routes the low level interrupts into the
                    forth inner interpreter. The inner interpreter
                    switches the execution to a predefined word if an
                    interrupt occurs. When that word finishes execution,
                    the interrupted word is continued. The interrupt
                    handlers are completely normal forth colon words
                    without any stack effect. They do not get interrupted
                    themselves.

                <sect3><title>Example Interrupt Handling</title>
                <para> The example illustrates the basic usage of interrupts. The

                </para>
                <para>
                We use the timer/counter 0 to generate an interrupt any time the 
                overflow condition is triggered. It is a 8bit counter, the input
                is the internal oscillator using a prescaler of 1024. The overflow
                value is set to 256. This gives an interrupt rate of frequency/(1024*256).
                At 8Mhz this will be 32 interrupts per second.

                <para>
                    The processing of interrupts takes place in two steps:
                    The first one is the low level part.
                    It is called whenever an interrupt occurs. The code
                    is the same for all interrupts. It takes the number
                    of the interrupt from its vector address and stores
                    this in a RAM cell. Then the low level ISR sets the
                    <command>T</command>
                    flag in the status register of the controller and returns
                    with RET.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The second step is taken from the inner interpreter. 
                    It checks the T-flag every time it is entered and, 
                    if it is set, it switches to interrupt
                    handling at forth level. This approach has a penalty
                    of 1 CPU cycle for checking and skipping the branch
                    instruction to the isr forth code if no interrupt
                    occurred.
                </para>
		<para> If an interrupt is detected, the forth VM clears the
		  T-flag and continues with the word <command>ISR-EXEC</command>. 
		  This word reads the currently active interrupt number and calls 
		  the associated execution token.  When this word is finished, 
		  the word <command>ISR-END</command> is called. This word clears 
		  the interrupt flag for the controller (RETI).
		</para>
		<para>This interrupt processing has two advantages: There are
		  no lost interrupts (the controller itself disables interrupts
		  within interrupts and re-transmits newly discovered interrupts
		  afterwards) and it is possible to use standard forth words
		  to deal with any kind of interrupts.
		</para>
       <para>
            Interrupts from some hardware sources (e.g. the usart)
            need to be cleared from the Interrupt Service Routine.
		    If this is not done within the ISR, the interrupt
		    is re-triggered immediatly after the ISR returned control.
        </para>
		<para>The downside is a relatively long latency since the the
		  forth VM has to be synchronized with the interrupt handling
		  code in order to use normal colon words as ISR. This penalty
		  is usually small since only words in assembly can cause the 
		  delay.

                    The User Area is used to provide task local
                    information. Without an active multitasker it
                    contains the starting values for the stackpointers,
                    the deferred words for terminal IO, the BASE

                    The flash memory is divided into 4 sections. The
                    first section, starting at address 0, contains the
                    interrupt vector table for the low level interrupt
                    handling and a character string with the name of the
                    controller in plain text.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The 2nd section contains the low level interrupt
                    handling routines. The interrupt handler is very
                    closely tied to the inner interpreter. It is located
                    near the first section to use the faster relative
                    jump instructions.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The 3rd section is the first part of the dictionary.
                    Nearly all colon words are located here. New words
                    are appended to this section. This section is filled
                    with FFFF cells when flashing the controller
                    initially. The current write pointer is the <code>DP</code>
                    pointer.

                    The last section is identical to the boot loader

                    area. Here is the heart of amforth: The inner

                    The reason for this split is a technical one: to
                    work with a dictionary in flash the controller needs
                    to write to the flash. The ATmega architecture
                    provides a mechanism called self-programming by
                    using a special instruction and a rather complex
                    algorithm. This instruction only works in the boot
                    loader/NRWW section. amforth uses this instruction
                    in the word I!. Due to the fact that the self
                    programming is a lot more then only a simple
                    instruction, amforth needs most of the forth core
                    system to achieve it. A side effect is that amforth
                    cannot co-exist with classic boot loaders. If a
                    particular boot loader provides an API to enable
                    applications to call the flash write operation,
                    amforth can be restructured to use it. Currently
                    only very few and seldom used boot loaders exist that
                    enable this feature.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Atmegas can have more than 64 KB Flash. This
                    requires more than a 16 bit address, which is more
                    than the cell size. For one type of those bigger
                    atmegas there will be an solution with 16 bit cell
                    size: Atmega128 Controllers. They can use the whole
                    address range with an interpretation trick: The flash
                    addresses are in fact not byte addresses but word
                    addresses. Since amforth does not deal with bytes
                    but cells it is possible to use the whole address
                    range with a 16 bit cell. The Atmegas with 128
                    KBytes Flash operate slightly slower since the
                    address interpretation needs more code to access the
                    flash (both read and write). The source code uses
                    assembly macros to hide the differences.
                </para>
                <para>
                An alternative approach to place the elements in the flash shows picture
                . Here all code goes into the RWW section. This layout definitely needs a
                routine in the NRWW section that provides a cell level flash write functionality.
                The usual boot loaders do not have such an runtime accessible API, only the 
                DFU boot loader from atmel found on some USB enabled controllers does.

                        <command>I!</command>
                        (i-store). This word takes the value and the
                        address of a single cell to be written to flash
                        from the data stack. The address is a word
                        address, not a byte address!

                        The flash write strategy follows Atmel's
                        appnotes. The first step is turning off all
                        interrupts. Then the affected flash page is read
                        into the flash page buffer. While doing the
                        copying a check is performed whether a flash
                        erase cycle is needed. The flash erase can be
                        avoided if no bit is turned from 0 to 1. Only if
                        a bit is switched from 0 to 1 must a flash page
                        erase operation be done. In the fourth step the
                        new flash data is written and the flash is set
                        back to normal operation and the interrupt flag
                        is restored. The whole process takes a few
                        milliseconds.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        This write strategy ensures that the flash has
                        minimal flash erase cycles while extending the
                        dictionary. In addition it keeps the forth
                        system simple since it does not need to deal
                        with page sizes or RAM based buffers for
                        dictionary operations.

                    The built-in EEPROM contains vital dictionary
                    pointer and other persistent data. They need only a
                    few EEPROM cells. The remaining space is available
                    for user programs. The easiest way to use EEPROM is
                    the use of forth VALUEs. There intended design
                    pattern (read often, write seldom) is like that for

                    Another use for EEPROM cells is to hold execution
                    tokens. The default system uses this for the turnkey
                    vector. This is an EEPROM variable that reads and
                    executes the XT at runtime. It is based on the
                    DEFER/IS standard. To define a deferred word in the
                    EEPROM use the Edefer definition word. The standard
                    word IS is used to put a new XT into it.
