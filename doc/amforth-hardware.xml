			<para>amforth is designed to run on AVR Atmega
				microcontrollers. It requires
				ca 7KB flash memory for the basic
				system and can address 128KB of
				flash memory.
		</para>
			<para>The ATtiny microcontrollers and a a few ATmega types lack
				the minimum
				flash capacity. The ATtiny's some machine instructions as
				well. </para>

			<para>Microcontrollers with more than 128KB flash
				memory are currently not
				usable.</para>

			<para>Most bootloaders will not work with amforth since they do
				not provide an
				application programming interface to rewrite a single
				flash cell. The default
				setup will thus replace any bootloader found
				with some core
				routines.</para>
			<para>
				It is possible to change the word
				<code>i!</code>
				to use an API and work
				with existing bootloaders.

			<para> Amforth uses the self programming feature of the ATmega
				microcontrollers to work with the dictionary. It is ok to use the
				factory default settings plus the changes for the oscillator
				settings. It is recommended to use a higher CPU frequency to meet
				the timing requirements of the serial terminal.</para>
