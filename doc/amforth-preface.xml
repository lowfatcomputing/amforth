		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>Amforth is a Forth system for the AVR ATmega microcontroller
			family. It works on the controller itself and does not depend on any
			additional hard- or software. It places no restrictions on using
			external hardware.</para>
		<para>Amforth implements a large subset of the Forth standard ANS94.
			Most of the CORE and CORE EXT words and a varying number of words
			from the other word sets are implemented. It is very easy to extend
			or shrink the actual word list for a specific application by just
			editing the dictionary include files.</para>
		<para> The dictionary is located in the flash memory. The built-in
			compiler extends it directly.</para>
		<para> amforth provides full access to all interrupts. The interrupt
			handler routines can be code or forth words.</para>
		<para>Amforth is published under the GNU General Public License
			version 2.</para>
		<para>The name amforth has no special meaning.</para>
		<para>Amforth is a new implementation. The first code was written in
			the summer of 2006. It is written "from scratch" using assembly
			language and forth itself. It does not have a direct relationship to
			any other forth system.</para>
